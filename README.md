A combination of temperature gauge and pan

In cooking it is important to know the temperature of the pan. It is very cumbersome to use external devices to measure the temperature.

Tfal has a patent of "red dot". They put a red dot which changes color in certain temperature into their non-stick coating of the pan. When the temperature of the pan reaches its sweat spot, the red dot turns brighter, so the user can start cooking. However, if the user wants different temperature, it is not working.

A new idea to improve this situation is to put a temperature gauge into the pan, so the user can directly read out the temperature of the pan, and the user can not just determine at what temperature to starting cooking, but also to control the temperature of the pan during cooking process, in order to meet certain requirement of recipe.

One way to implement this is to put the tip of temperature gauge at the bottom of the pan when making the pan by casting or forging, so the tip is embeded into the bottom of the pan, therefore to ensure correct reading of the temperature of the pan.
