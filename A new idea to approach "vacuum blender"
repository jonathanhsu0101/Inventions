The principle of vacuum blender is to reduce oxygen in the blender, in order to reduce oxidation in and after blending process.

Usually it uses a vacuum pump to suck out air in the blender.

An alternative way to reduce oxygen is to purge air out by oxygen-free gases, e. g. nitrogen.

Among all oxygen-free gases, nitrogen is most inexpensive.

Nitrogen can be provided by nitrogen generator, liquid nitrogen tank, etc.

To get the best and fastest effect of purge, nitrogen can be introduced into the bottom of blender. A check valve should be installed to prevent back flow of juice into nitrogen generator.

The blender can be encased in an outer closure. However, to further reduce cost, it is not necessary.
