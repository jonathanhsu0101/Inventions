The principle of vacuum blender is to reduce oxygen in the blender, in order to reduce oxidation in and after blending process.

Usually it uses a vacuum pump to suck out air in the blender.

An alternative way to reduce oxygen is to purge air out by oxygen-free gases, e. g. nitrogen or CO2.

Among all oxygen-free gases, nitrogen and CO2 is most inexpensive.

Nitrogen can be provided by nitrogen generator, liquid nitrogen tank, etc.

CO2 can be provided by cartidge, CO2 generator, liquid CO2 tank, etc.

To get the best and fastest effect of purge, oxygen-free gas can be introduced into the bottom of blender. A check valve should be installed to prevent back flow of juice.

The blender can be encased in an outer closure. However, to further reduce cost, it is not necessary.

Another way is to burn out oxygen in blender. Oxygen can be consumed by burner. Attach a small burner to the blender through two tubes and circulate the air will do the job. Or I can put a combustible gas, e.g. propane, in the blender and burn it. Propane gas bottle is cheap and safe. I only need a propane gas bottle, a tube, and an igniter. 

The above ideas can also be added to a vacuum blender as a new feature, to improve the performace of vacuum blender.

Another idea is to enclose the entire blender in an enclosure, and pump out all air inside including the motor, in order to eliminate noise.
